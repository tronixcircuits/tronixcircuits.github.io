              Tronixworkshop is a blog about the electronics projects
              created and built in my home workshop using anything I can get my hands on from
              555 timers to microcontrollers from FPGA's to Operational Amplifiers.

            <p>
              Discover how I turned my unused garage space into a respectable electronics
              laboratory and hacker space, used to create some excellent open source projects
              and gadgets that I share with you. Learn and understand about the tools, techniques,
              and craft used to turn wonderful ideas into a reality.
