A simple breadboard circuit of an arduino uno and ftdi breakout.

Circuit design needed, with ftdi wiring.

Building simple Arduino Uno circuits is often quite tedious with the PCB, especially when using this with a breadboard. I prefer to have the design together where I can experiment for a longer amount of time?, often with the fixed PCB the wires pop out this quite annoying. And for larger designs.
