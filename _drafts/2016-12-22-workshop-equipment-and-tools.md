In this post I will go through the tools and equipment that I am currently using and how I've organised my components, this post follows on from [part 2] where I showed you how I constructed my benches<!--more-->

## Introduction

Typical electronics workshops have all the typical kinds of tools you would find in any kind of workshop and mine is no different, there is however almost certainly a must have list that I couldn't do without.

## Tools

Need a list of everyday tools, with pictures
Breadboards, Veroboard, Mini Drill

### Components and storage

My components drawers are full of parts I've either bought or de-soldered from old electronics, due to the cost of most electronics I reckon this is a pretty standard move. Most of the projects I've built in the past were pulled apart and reused when I got bored of them, or when I ran out of money to fund my hobby. Over the years and as components have got cheaper, especially imported ones, my collection has grown. It starts to get a little unwieldy when the component you are looking for is in a box or a antistatic bag, and guess what them bags all look the same? So start early and avoid the headache of messy component storage. My resistor are arranged in the E12 series, put all the 1's, 2.2's, 2.7's, 3.3 and so on together regardless of multiplier. Use the same approach with capacitors as well. Everything else is labelled up very generically, or tried to be, to make it easier to find them when looking. Since I don't usually get much time to work in the shop, I needed a setup that would allow me to pickup where I left off and be as productive on whatever project I'm currently working on.

### Soldering Equipment

It is really surprising to here people still have plug-in-the-wall fire starter soldering irons, really! them things should be banned. If you are really serious about getting into electronics invest in your tools. Get a soldering station, Weller, Hacko, etc. I currently have an old Weller, It's served my well over the years, buts it's time for a new one.

lighting, PCB Jig, de-soldering tools.

### PCB Equipment

UV exposure box
I've had an bubble etching tank for a few years now, unfortunately it has a slow leak, its really useful when you want to make a simple PCB for prototyping.

### Test Equipment

1.Current regulated Voltage Supply
2.Oscilloscope
3.Multimeter
4.Signal/Function Generator
