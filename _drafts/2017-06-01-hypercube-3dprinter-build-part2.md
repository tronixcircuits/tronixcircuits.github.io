Last November (2016) I started building my first project in the workshop, the HyperCube 3d printer. Its been a struggle to complete this post after becoming a father for the second time in January.

3d printers are a great tool to rapidly prototype designs cheaply and easily, building your own printer can be quite challenging, but its something I've always wanted to do. I found a design online that was both cheap a easy to build. This will be the start of the a series of posts following my build.
