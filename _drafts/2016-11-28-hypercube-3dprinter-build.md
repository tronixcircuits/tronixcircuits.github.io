3d printers are a great tool to rapidly prototype designs cheaply and easily, building your own printer can be quite challenging, but its something I've always wanted to do. I found a design online that was both cheap a easy to build. This will be the start of the a series of posts following my build.

## Introduction
The printer I chose to build is called the [HyperCube] and was designed By [Tech2c on YouTube], I really liked this design because of its simplicity while still fulfilling the requirements of a great 3D printer. This build is based on a [CoreXY] design, uses a cantilever Z axis for the bed, and the X axis uses light weight anodised Aluminium tubes instead of solid steels ones. The frame of the printer is built with T-Slot Aluminium extrusion and T-Slot nuts making assembly extremely simple. The aluminium was bought in 1.5 meter lengths and cut down to size to save a little money, I was happy to follow Tech2c exact method of cutting this extrusion using a metre block, which turned out with precise results.

The cut down extrusion pieces are fastened together with aluminium corner brackets, the combination of the T-Slot nuts and these corner brackets make for a really solid frame.

My 3D printed parts were printed by a local printer I found on 3DHubs called [chunky-steveo], 3dhubs is an excellent service and is great if you don't have access to a printer but need prints for your design, it solved my catch 22 problem when build this printer. The parts took about 10 days to discuss, negotiate a price, print and ship, there is 41 parts in total for this design.

(part 1) - Building the frame

Frame:
T-Slot 2020 Aluminium Extrusion Profiles for X200 x Y200 x Z155 print bed area

4 x 340mm (X) = 1360 (135)
4 x 303mm (Y) = 1212 (283)
4 x 350mm (Z) = 1400 (95)
2 x 285mm (Bed) = 570 (925)
1 x 135mm (Bed)

Step 1 cut the extrusion lengths to size
Step 2 build the frame with corner brackets, and build the bed
Step 3 attach the shaft clamps to hold the steel smooth rod, note: the left motor mount.
