3d printers are a great tool to rapidly prototype designs cheaply and easily, building your own printer can be quite challenging, but its something I've always wanted to do. I found a design online that was both cheap a easy to build. This will be the start of the a series of posts following my build.

## Introduction
The printer I chose to build is called the [HyperCube] and was designed By [Tech2c on YouTube], I really liked this design because of its simplicity while still fulfilling the requirements of a great 3D printer. This build is based on a [CoreXY] design, uses a cantilever Z axis for the bed, and the X axis uses light weight anodised Aluminium tubes instead of solid steels ones. The frame of the printer is built with T-Slot Aluminium extrusion and T-Slot nuts making assembly extremely simple. The aluminium was bought in 1.5 meter lengths and cut down to size to save a little money, I was happy to follow Tech2c exact method of cutting this extrusion using a metre block, which turned out with precise results.

The cut down extrusion pieces are fastened together with aluminium corner brackets, the combination of the T-Slot nuts and these corner brackets make for a really solid frame.

My 3D printed parts were printed by a local printer I found on 3DHubs called [chunky-steveo], 3dhubs is an excellent service and is great if you don't have access to a printer but need prints for your design, it solved my catch 22 problem when build this printer. The parts took about 10 days to discuss, negotiate a price, print and ship, there is 41 parts in total for this design.

(part 1) - Building the frame

The aluminium extrusion used for the frame build was a slightly different type from the one Tech2c used in his build, the type I acquired was listed as type-I slot 5, this was lost on me, it meant 5 mm slot. The t-slot nuts used required a 6mm slot, this still works ok, however the nuts don't drop straight in, there's a slight knack to getting them in and to horizontally lay flat in the T-slot.

I first built up two of the side squares using x (340mm) and z (350mm). Using aluminium corner brackets to join the lengths together. Once the two frames were constructed these were joined together with two corner brackets to the y (303mm) lengths of extrusion. The two frames were checked with a tri-square for any deviation in the corner brackets and extrusion cuts that may have cause variations in the cube.

Once these two frames are joined together the y axis brackets and axis steel rods could be fitted to the frame, also adding a bearings to the steel rod.

At point it's time to assemble the xy joiners  with the anodised aluminium rods. The xy joiners need rollers with a 20mm m3 hex screw and nut. The aluminium is clamped in place with 20mm m3 screws as well.

When the x carriage assembly has been constructed it's time to attached it to the y axis bearings. This part was the most time consuming aspect of this design, the xy joiner covers if over tightened may cause the carriage to screw slightly. To overcome this I first attached the carriage to the bearings and adjusted for the best travel and smoothness to see if any binding was present. Attaching the covers however can affect


Frame:
T-Slot 2020 Aluminium Extrusion Profiles for X200 x Y200 x Z155 print bed area

4 x 340mm (X) = 1360 (135)
4 x 303mm (Y) = 1212 (283)
4 x 350mm (Z) = 1400 (95)
2 x 285mm (Bed) = 570 (925)
1 x 135mm (Bed)

Step 1 cut the extrusion lengths to size
Step 2 build the frame with corner brackets, and build the bed
Step 3 attach the shaft clamps to hold the steel smooth rod, note: the left motor mount.
