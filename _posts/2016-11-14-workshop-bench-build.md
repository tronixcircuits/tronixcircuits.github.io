The first bench I built for conduit installation wasn't fit for purpose and I needed to rethink the design. Most designs on the net seemed to be woodworking designs. I wanted a bench that was both sturdy and simple to build.  <!--more-->

## Bench Build

I went with a straight forward frame this was going to pinned to wall from the back. The front legs would hold all the downward weight, which most of the time would be the bench weight itself and few components and instruments. I originally thought that the bench could be pinned to the wall using rawlbolts, however this turned out to be a bad idea. The wood I used was 3inch by 3inch square, with a MDF top of 600 * 2400 18mm thickness. This presented a problem, I couldn't find rawlbolts long enough. I did however buy some long screws to fix the frame together at each corner. These came in handy, as I ended up scraping the rawlbolts idea.
