It all started last summer, that is I decided to convert my garage into an electronics workshop. The first part was relatively painless, I wanted a nice bright lab so I good paint job was the first task. It took several coats and over several week to finally finish. <!--more-->

Next of course was to improve the poor lighting, I added four more standard tubes, wiring these into the existing circuit made my head spin! Partly due to the extra wiring feed from light on our ground floor, as the garage taps into the ground floor sockets and lights circuit.

### Preparation

Once the light were on, I gave the floor a nice new coat of garage floor paint to brighten it up a little and hide my messy paint drips. With a nice bright garage I needed a bench to help with conduit installation.

I first went with the same approach as Dave Jones from EEVBlog [How To Build An Electronics Work Bench][bench-build], but he used pine where I used timber and MDF. The result was too wobbly for a workbench but it was fine as a temporary solution to do some conduit installation.

I screwed angled brackets to the MDF, in hide sight this wasn't a great idea because the MDF board wasn't strong enough and under and weight strain the bench top would start to bow. Dave uses a much stronger thicker wood, but this was all I could acquire in my price range.

### Conduit Installation and Wiring

I wanted to put 6 sockets equally spaced around the walls where I planned to build my benches. Me being a bit of a perfectionist opted for galvanised steel conduit rather then using standard 4 way extensions and sticking them to the wall. I also wanted the extra safety of having an extra garage consumer unit, it probably doesn't make any difference having it, since the supply is feed from the house consumer unit but in my mind having an extra fuse between me and 240 volts is always a good thing. It will also allow me to add an isolation transformer in the future with is generally good practice.

I went with 20mm conduit and so I could use 4mm cable for the wiring which would allow 32A maximum according to the ratings.

I started with a rough guide line to workout the height and where sockets would go.

I bolted my conduit vice to my bench and started cutting pieces to length, once the piece was the correct size, this is easier said since the overall size had to include the thread for the coupler. I used a 20mm die to put about 5-10mm of thread depending on how accurate my cuts were.

I gave up in the winter and waited for warmer weather in the spring. I carried on with the conduit installation where I left off.

I attached the conduit to the wall with conduit saddles, however these were rubbish I looked all over for better quality ones but at the time most suppliers had none in stock. These bad quality ones made the alignment alone the wall terrible.

When I had a couple of attached I could then add
