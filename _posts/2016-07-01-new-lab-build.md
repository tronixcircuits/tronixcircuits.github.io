It all started last summer, that is I decided to convert my garage into an electronics workshop. The first part was relatively painless, I wanted a nice bright lab so I good paint job was the first task. It took several coats and over several week to finally finish. <!--more-->

Next of course was to improve the poor lighting, I added four more standard tubes, wiring these into the existing circuit made my head spin! Partly due to the extra wiring feed from light on our ground floor, as the garage taps into the ground floor sockets and lights circuit.

### Preparation

Once the light were on, I gave the floor a nice new coat of garage floor paint to brighten it up a little and hide my messy paint drips. With a nice bright garage I needed a bench to help with conduit installation. I first went with the same approach as Dave Jones from EEVBlog, How To Build An Electronics Work Bench, but Dave used pine where I used timber and MDF. The result was too wobbly for a workbench but it was fine as a temporary solution to do some conduit installation.

I screwed angled brackets to the MDF, in hindsight this wasn't a great idea because the MDF board wasn't strong enough and under and weight strain the bench top would start to bow. Dave uses a much stronger thicker wood, but this was all I could acquire in my price range.

At the top of the bench I used 1 by 3 inch timber to give a bench a little stability, I didn't bother with the bottom since by this point I was already rethinking the design.

### Conduit Installation and Wiring

I wanted to put 6 sockets equally spaced around the walls where I planned to build my benches. Me being a bit of a perfectionist opted for galvanised steel conduit rather then using standard 4 way extensions and sticking them to the wall. I also wanted the extra safety of having an extra garage consumer unit, it probably doesn't make any difference having it, since the supply is feed from the house consumer unit but in my mind having an extra fuse between me and 240 volts is always a good thing. It will also allow me to add an isolation transformer in the future with is generally good practice.

I went with 20mm conduit and so I could use 4mm cable for the wiring which would allow 32A maximum according to the ratings.

I started with a rough guide line to workout the height and where sockets would go.

I bolted my conduit vice to my bench and started cutting pieces to length, once the piece was the correct size, this is easier said since the overall size had to include the thread for the coupler. I used a 20mm die to put about 5-10mm of thread depending on how accurate my cuts were.

I gave up in the winter and waited for warmer weather in the spring. I carried on with the conduit installation where I left off.

I attached the conduit to the wall with conduit saddles, however these were rubbish I looked all over for better quality ones but at the time most suppliers had none in stock. These bad quality ones made the alignment alone the wall terrible.

The feed into the socket would come from my consumer unit, I roughly marked out where the original socket wire came into the garage, however I later discovered this to be a mistake, and attached the consumer unit above. (Expand)

When I had a couple of pieces attached I could then add a two-way socket back box  and coupled it through the side with a brass bushing. This process of cutting the conduit pieces to length, threading the ends and bridging with sockets continued until I had a continuous piece of conduit all around my work area. I also wanted to replace the old plastic double socket with a steel one.

Now I originally assumed the feed came into the garage from the bottom, through a hole in the wall the wires originally tacked on with cable grippers. When I replaced the socket I realised that the feed came into the garage from the fuse spur. This might seem blazing obvious, but this mean the fuse spur would turn off all ground floor sockets, even the ones in our utility room the other side of the garage wall! Since we even turned it off we never even knew! I solved the problem with a oversized adaptable box, only size I could find that would look ok. The last piece of conduit was an almost perfect fit, by that time I'd mastered it.

![conduit-installation-electronics-lab][conduit4]

Once the conduit was done, it was time to run some wires, as I said before I opted for 4mm tri-rated cable, in hindsight maybe should have increased the conduit diameter to 25mm, because get the wires in and around was a challenge and also due to the razor sharp socket back boxes my fingers were shredded. The trickiest part was getting the wires up and through to the consumer unit.

The last job was to wire up the sockets and the finally connect the consumer unit up to the feed into the garage from the house.

![wiring-up-electronics-lab][wiring3]

If I was gonna do this again, I may have changed a few things, firstly a thicker conduit or maybe even a trunking, with a single conduit branched off to the needed socket might have been a better solution. My conduit vice was a cheap one from eBay if you're not careful you can mark the conduit very easily. All in all though the result is a nice finish to any workshop hiding the wiring away and safely protects it.
